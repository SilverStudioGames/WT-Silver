# cc_st_intro  automatically plays when starting slytherin tier

# cc_st_start unlocks once you've convinced Cho to use tactics against slytherin (Will need some work as I don't know the code)
# cc_st_return_E1 Is the return event as Slytherin wont practice, practice locks after this event as Slytherins doesn't show up
#To play practice again you need to talk to Tonks to convince them to play again cc_st_tonks_E1 (cc_st_snape_E1 is optional until you talk to tonks)
# Hermione shows up next day after this event saying that she wont play cc_st_hermione_E1 once she leaves it unlocks the ability to blackmail her cc_st_hermione_blackmail

# cc_st_return_E2 Is the return event when Cho has practiced against Slytherins. Once this event finished one of two requirements to start the main match is completed (other being blackmail Hermione)
#cc_st_hermione_blackmail is one of two requirements to play the main match (other being cc_st_return_E2)

    "It was a normal night..."
    "I was sitting in my office as usual, slowly chipping away at some left over paperwork..."
    "Leaning back in my chair, I closed my eyes for a moment, thinking back on recent events."
    "It has been a weird few days for sure... Not just my appearing in this office, but also the whole situation in general..."
    "I sat back up and hunched myself over the parchment."
    "Well, I guess it could be worse... Weather is... acceptable."
    "Why do I have to do this stuff again? Surely there should be some kind of secretary around..."
    "Suddenly the door opened as if my wishes had come true...{w=0.5} Something about this felt backwards somehow."

    her "Mr. D."
    "Said the figure at the door, appearing as merely a shadow in the low light..."
    m "(Mr... what?)"
    "I thought...{w=0.3} Now trying my best to focus on the figure in front of me."
    "Mr. D?"
    "After hearing the urgent tone in the voice, I responded... seemingly out of reflex..."
    m "Yes?"
    "The figure shifted their posture in a relieved fashion, as if they had been trying to get a hold of me for hours, and said..."
    her "Mr. D... I've been trying to contact you for hours. But it looks like your phone may be off..."
    m "My phone?"
    "I said in a puzzled manner..."
    "I never had a phone in here... in fact, there's not a single electronic device in this office..."
    "After a few moments the figure stepped into the light, illuminating a girl's face."

    "Her hazel coloured flowing hair reminded me of a leather bound book, filled to the brim with the secrets of the girl in front of me..."
    "I felt myself becoming lost in her mysterious brown eyes, which provoked a sense of great pain and suffering."
    her "I'm so glad I found you... I've been trying to locate you for ages, you're not an easy man to find..."
    "Lost in thought, my mouth seemed to move on its own as I replied to the girl..."
    m "Of course..."
    "Taken aback by my own automatic response, I thought to myself... "
    m "(What am I doing, this girl seems to think I'm someone called... Mr. D?)"
    "Surely that can't be me... unless this is some other secret alias of mine... It appears she may know me though, I better press further..."
    her "I knew you were good, but I didn't think you'd manage to do it as discretely as you did...."
    her "How professional..."
    her "And such a looker too... I can't believe we've just met..."
    "The only thing I could gather so far is that I must've helped her with some sort of delicate matter..."
    "I looked down at my papers again, trying to find some kind of clue what this might be..."
    "Tax fraud?"
    her "..."
    "The girl stood there for a minute, looking as if she wanted to say something but being unsure how to go about doing so..."
    "My eyes met with hers again, as I looked back up from my desk."
    her "..."
    "She blushed, now with a slightly guilty expression, fidgeting and clearly out of her comfort zone..."
    "As I was about to open my mouth and speak, a voice that came from no specific direction chimed in before I even got a word out..."
